## Explanation for each data file

For each .npz file in above folders, it contains Raw data of three-exposures LDRs and corresponding HDR GT in raw format (except for the test data in test_withoutGT folder). The Raw data of each exposure has been processed through black level correction and normalization. We split the RAW data with shape of H and W into four sub-matrix with shape of H/2 and W/2 based on the bayer pattern. The four sub-matrix are concatenated as four-channel matrix in B-G-G-R sequential. Furthermore, we obtain the corresponding luminance-aligned data for each LDR by dividing it with exposuse ratio, which also owns four channel finally. Lastly, we concatenate the origianl raw data and the corresponding luminance-aligned data as an eight-channel matrix for each LDR. Since the HDR GT does not need the luminace alignment, its has only four channels. Specifically, the components are arranged as below.

(The specific read operation for training has been offered in dataset.py)

```
#  Key_name Column_index1              Column_index2
---['sht']  [0:4] (original raw data)  [4:8] (luminace-aligned data)  # The data of short exposure
---['mid']  [0:4] (original raw data)  [4:8] (luminace-aligned data)  # The data of mid exposure
---['lng']  [0:4] (original raw data)  [4:8] (luminace-aligned data)  # The data of long exposure
---['hdr']  [0:4] (hdr GT)

```
